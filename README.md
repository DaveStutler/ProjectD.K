## Gameplay Explanation ##

Each player has their own unique skill:
- Player 1: Press `W`, `A`, or `D` keys for basic movement. Has a **DASH left or right** after pressing `S`.

- Player 2: Press `I`, `J`, or `L` keys for basic movement. Can **GROW and SHRINK in size** when pressing `K`.

- Player 3: Uses the number pad keys `4`, `6`, or `8` for basic movement. They donâ€™t have another key for their ability but can DOUBLE JUMP by pressing `8` twice on the number pad.

Each player has a collision with each other, which is necessary at times to clear puzzles. 

Players are bound to the screen with the camera being unable to move when players are at opposing sides of the screen.

For best results, use and combine skills to their fullest in order to solve puzzles and obtain the three keys required to beat the level. 

Puzzles have platforms that are created or walls that are destroyed to get to the end of the level and need to be solved in order to obtain a key.
